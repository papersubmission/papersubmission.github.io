          Refactoring is a common practice employed by practitioners along software evolution. Smells can be used as indicators of the need for refactoring. However, the decision on when to refactor is not so cut-and-dried. Software developers are expected to refactor the source code as soon as it smells, i.e. when there is an initial sign of structural degradation. On the other hand, developers might decide to postpone refactoring until when code elements are highly degraded. In other words, different stages of degradation may lead developers to refactor. Unfortunately, there is not much understanding of how often refactorings are applied on these stages of degradation. In our study, we analyzed the frequency of refactorings on modules representing different levels of structural degradation. Different from other studies, we have empirically investigated 50 projects taking into account different stages of degradation. Our results indicate that developers tend to apply refactoring in elements with different degradation stages. Nevertheless, refactorings were most frequently applied when code manifested the worst stage of degradation.

            The second scenario comprises developers assigned to identify design problems in systems with which they are unfamiliar, i.e., systems that they did not implement.
            In order to select developers for this scenario, we recruited a set of developers, and we asked them to answer a questionnaire. The goal was to determine which of
            them were eligible for the study. The questionnaire covers information to characterize the developers about their education level and knowledge of Java programming
            and code smells. In order to select a developer for the study, he would need to meet some requirements.Thus, we analyzed their answers based on the following requirements:

            <ol>

                <li>R1. Four years or more of experience with software development and maintenance. We have chosen four years because this is the average time used by companies such
                    as Yahoo <a href="#yahoo">(Yahoo, 2016)</a> and Twitter <a href="#twitter">(Twitter, 2016)</a> to classify a developer as experienced.</li>

                <li>R2. No previous knowledge about S6 and S7.</li>

                <li>R3. At least basic knowledge about code smells.</li>

                <li>R4. At least intermediary knowledge on Java programming. </li>

            We included in the questionnaire a description of our definition of knowledge level, thereby allowing developers to have a similar interpretation of the possible answers.

            We selected two systems from the <a href="http://oodt.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache OODT</a> project (Push Pull and Workflow Manager), and we asked developers of Group 2 to identify design problems in these systems. We selected these systems because they have a well-defined set of design problems identified by developers who actually implemented the systems. We gave them a document containing: (i) a brief description of Push Pull (S6) and Workflow Manager (S7), and (ii) a very high level description of their design blueprint. We gave them these documents because when they have to maintain unfamiliar systems, they need to have some minimal information about the systems to be maintained. We used the same document provided in the OODT project. Document with the description of both systems can be downloaded at <a href="download/oodtdoc.zip">here</a>.

            A code smell is a structure in the implementation of the program that possibly indicates a design problem <a href="#fowler">(Fowler, 1999)</a>. In this study, we have focus on 15 types of code smells. We present the definition of the code smells following:

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blob Class:</strong> Long and complex class that centralizes the intelligence of the system.</li>

            <li><strong>Class Data Should Be Private:</strong> A class exposing its fields, violating the principle of data hiding.</li>

            <li><strong>Complex Class:</strong> A class having at least one method having a high cyclomatic complexity.</li>

            <li><strong>Data Class:</strong> A class has this code smell when it has only fields, getting and setting methods for the fields, and nothing else. The aim is to hold data and, consequently, be manipulated by other classes.</li>

            <li><strong>Divergent Change:</strong> This code smell occurs when one class is commonly changed in different ways for different reasons.</li>

            <li><strong>Feature Envy:</strong> Feature envy occurs in a class when the method of that class seems more interested in a class other than the one it actually belongs.</li>

            <li><strong>God Class:</strong> This code smell occurs when the class centralizes more the one functionality, realizing more than one purpose.</li>

            <li><strong>Lazy Class: A class having very small dimension, few methods and with low complexity.</strong> </li>

            <li><strong>Long Method:</strong> This code smell occurs when a method has grown too large, containing too many lines of code.</li>

            <li><strong>Long Parameter List:</strong> This code smell occurs in a method that has a long list of parameters, in which makes readability and code quality worse.</li>

            <li><strong>Message Chain:</strong> A long chain of method invocations is performed to implement a class functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Refused Bequest:</strong> A subclass that uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents.</li>

            <li><strong>Shotgun Surgery:</strong> This code smell is the opposite of Divergent Change. It happens when every time a kind of change is made in the code, that change triggers many little changes in many different classes.</li>

            <li><strong>Spaghetti Code:</strong> A class implementing complex methods interacting with them, with no parameters, using global variables.</li>

            <li><strong>Speculative Generality:</strong> A class declared as abstract having very few children classes that use its methods.</li>
